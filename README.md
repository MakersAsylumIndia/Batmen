Hey there! 👋

Welcome to the documentation space for our **Innovation School Project**:  
**Plastic Patrol – an all-terrain robot designed to scoop up plastic waste and clean the environment.**

This robot helps tackle the global plastic pollution crisis by collecting scattered waste from parks, beaches, streets, and uneven terrain — all autonomously or via remote control.

---

## 🚩 Quick Intro

🔹 **Problem**: Plastic waste is polluting our environment, especially in hard-to-reach areas like rough terrains, parks, and beaches.

🔹 **Solution**: A compact, rugged, and smart robot that can traverse all terrains and collect plastic debris using a scooping mechanism, contributing to cleaner public spaces and environmental sustainability.
